Covid-19 Analysis and Visualization using Plotly Express
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this project, I will discuss Analyse Covid-19 data and will visualize it using Plotly Express in Python. This Project deals with creating dozens of bar charts, line graphs, bubble charts, scatter plots. The graph that will be made in this project will be of excellent quality. Envisioning COVID-19 will primarily be using Plotly Express for this project. The analysis and visualization enable people to understand complex scenarios and make predictions about the future from the current situation.

This analysis summarizes the modeling, simulation, and analytics work around the COVID-19 outbreak around the world from the perspective of data science and visual analytics. It examines the impact of best practices and preventive measures in various sectors and enables outbreaks to be managed with available health resources.

Tools and Technologies Used in the Project: Google Colab(Runtime type - GPU).



Importing three datasets into this project
